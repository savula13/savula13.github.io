<p> In 2021, the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services required hospitals to provide clear,
accessible pricing information about the items and services they provide in a machine-readable
format. <p>

<p> However, many of these files - called chargemasters - are locked in difficult to parse PDFs. An online community was able 
to crowd source data entry from these PDFs to aggregate structured datasets which included hospitals across the US, and associated
negotiated rates for items and services with various insurance companies <p>

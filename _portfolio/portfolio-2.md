<p> In 2021, the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services required hospitals to provide clear,
accessible pricing information about the items and services they provide in a machine-readable
format. <p>

<p> However, many of these files - called chargemasters - are locked in difficult to parse PDFs. An online community was able 
to crowd source data entry from these PDFs to aggregate structured datasets which included hospitals across the US, and associated
negotiated rates for items and services with various insurance companies. <p>


<p> For citizens and foreigners alike, insurance industry practices are opaque and hospital prices can vary dramatically in different regions of the United States. The recent publication of data provides a wealth of information which can be used as inputs with advanced ML techniques to determine if there are relationships between hospitals, insurance companies, and prices. <p>

<p> I aimed to evaluate models which can predict the price of a given item on a Michigan hospital’s chargemaster using data from the insurance company, the description of the item, and demographic information about the hospital’s location. <p>

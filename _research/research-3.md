I am working with researchers at the University of Michigan Ford School of Public Policy - STPP program on several projects:


1. Collaborating with team of computer scientists and policy experts to develop a community-based framework to ensure the responsible design, development, and deployment of technology. Currently engaging in co-design practices with people with disabilites and formerly incarcerated individuals to develop AI tools which empower these communities and policy reports to impact meaningful and structural changes to advance equity.

2. Writing a report on the ethical, privacy, and societal implications of recent government proposals to create a data platform to conduct autism research and recommended policy implementations.

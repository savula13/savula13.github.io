About Me
======

<p> Hi! My name is Sai Avula, and I am a currently Graduate Data Science student at the University of Michigan. <p>

<p> Before studying at Michigan, I worked at The MITRE Corporation as a Data Scientist where I investigated answers to complex public policy problems in areas
such as healthcare, data privacy, welfare, and supply chain logistics through leveraging advanced statistical analysis and applied machine learning techniques. <p>

<p> I'm passionate about building robust and equitable systems which can inform data-driven decisions. I'm particulary interested in deep learning 
for climate modeling, AI governance, scalable network analysis, and open source data provenance protocols. <p>

<p> Outside of work and school I love going to live music shows, watching and playing basketball and soccer, backpacking in the mountains, and 
music production! <p>

<p> I am currently looking for internships for Data Scientist and Machine Learning Engineer roles for Summer 2025. If there is an opportunity for which you think 
would be a great fit or if you want to chat about any of my interests please contact me through [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sai-avula/) or [email](sai.avula13@gmail.com). <p>

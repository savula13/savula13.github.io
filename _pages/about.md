<p> Hi! My name is Sai Avula, and I am a currently Data Science graduate student at the University of Michigan. <p>

<p> Prior to Michigan, I worked at The MITRE Corporation as a Data Scientist where I investigated complex public policy problems in areas
such as healthcare, data privacy, welfare, and supply chain logistics by leveraging advanced statistical analysis and applied machine learning techniques. <p>

<p> My academic and professional experiences have nurtured my passion for building robust and equitable systems
to inform data-driven decision making. My current research interests include deep learning 
for climate modeling, AI governance, scalable network analysis, and open source data provenance protocols. <p>

<p> Outside of work and school, I love traveling and trying new cuisines, playing basketball, learning music production, and backpacking in the mountains! <p>

<p> I am currently looking for internships for Data Scientist and Machine Learning Engineer roles for Summer 2025. If you are looking to connect with me an opportunity or if you want to chat about any of my interests please contact me through email or LinkedIn. <p>

<p> Here are some pics from my recent travels! <p>

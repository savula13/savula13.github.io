<p> Hi! My name is Sai Avula, and I am a currently Data Science graduate student at the University of Michigan. <p>

<p> Before Michigan, I worked at The MITRE Corporation as a Data Scientist where I investigated complex public policy problems in areas
such as healthcare, data privacy, welfare, and supply chain logistics by leveraging advanced statistical analysis and applied machine learning techniques. <p>

<p> I'm passionate about building robust and equitable systems to inform data-driven decision making. My research interests include deep learning 
for climate modeling, AI governance, scalable network analysis, and open source data provenance protocols. <p>

<p> Outside of work and school, I love traveling and trying new cuisines, playing basketball, learning music production, and backpacking in the mountains! <p>

<p> I am currently looking for internships for Data Scientist and Machine Learning Engineer roles for Summer 2025. If there is an opportunity you think would be a great fit or if you want to chat about any of my interests please contact me through email or LinkedIn. <p>

<p> Here are some pics from my recent travels! <p>

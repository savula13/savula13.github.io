<p> Hi! My name is Sai Avula, and I am a currently Data Science graduate student at the University of Michigan. <p>

<p> Prior to Michigan, I worked at The MITRE Corporation as a Data Scientist where I leveraged advanced statistical analysis and build machine learning tools to tackle complex public policy problems such as healthcare, data privacy, welfare, and supply chain logistics. <p>

<p> My academic and professional experiences have nurtured my passion for building robust and equitable systems
to inform data-driven decision making. My current research interests include deep learning 
for climate modeling, AI governance, participatory design, scalable network analysis, and open source data provenance protocols. <p>

<p> In my spare time, I love traveling and sampling new cuisines, playing pickup basketball, producing music, and backpacking in the mountains! <p>

<p> I am currently looking for full time for Data Scientist and Machine Learning Engineer roles. If you are looking to connect with me an opportunity or if you want to chat about any of my interests please contact me through email or LinkedIn. <p>

<p> Below are some pics from my favorite adventures! <p>
